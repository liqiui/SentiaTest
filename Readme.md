SentiaTest

This project is based on MVVM architecture, and implemented Android Architecture Components.
There are two pages, home page, which is displaying a list and a detail page which displays the detail of selected item.

It fetches data from https://f213b61d-6411-4018-a178-53863ed9f8ec.mock.pstmn.io/properties, which is a JSON object, and then parses this JSON object into data classes with Moshi.

The data would be saved in a LiveData and binding with the view with DataBinding.
